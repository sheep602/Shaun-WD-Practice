            <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
            <p>Bill Gates was born on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington. From a young age, he showed an interest in computing, which led him to pursue programming. At age 8, he began reading encyclopedias for fun. But in grade school, he was bored. His parents decided to send him to Lakeside, a private middle and high school.
                Gates wrote his first software program at the age of 13. In high school he helped form a group of programmers who computerized their school's payroll system and founded Traf-O-Data, a company that sold traffic-counting systems to local governments.
                Despite being admitted to the world's most prestigious university, billionaire Bill Gates decided to drop out to pursue his dreams of joining the software revolution! Bill Gates demonstrated an early interest in computers and programming. Bill Gates never finished his undergraduate degree — the billionaire dropped out of Harvard University after three semesters to start Microsoft. </p>
